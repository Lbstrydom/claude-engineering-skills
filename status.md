# Project Status Log

## 2026-03-31 — Final Review Fallback to Claude Opus

### Changes
- Implemented provider fallback in scripts/gemini-review.mjs so Step 6.5 now runs Gemini when available, then Claude Opus when Gemini credentials are missing.
- Added Claude Opus invocation path using @anthropic-ai/sdk with shared verdict schema parsing and consistent output metadata.
- Updated ping behavior in scripts/gemini-review.mjs to validate either Gemini or Claude Opus depending on available credentials.
- Updated final-review docs and skill instructions to reflect fallback order instead of skipping when GEMINI_API_KEY is absent.
- Added environment variable documentation for CLAUDE_FINAL_REVIEW_MODEL and clarified ANTHROPIC_API_KEY usage for final-review fallback.

### Files Affected
- scripts/gemini-review.mjs — Added runtime provider selection and Claude Opus fallback execution path.
- .github/skills/audit-loop/SKILL.md — Updated Step 6.5 fallback behavior for Copilot skill flow.
- .claude/skills/audit-loop/SKILL.md — Updated Step 6.5 fallback behavior for Claude Code skill flow.
- .env.example — Documented fallback behavior and CLAUDE_FINAL_REVIEW_MODEL.
- CLAUDE.md — Updated architecture and environment variable table for fallback design.
- README.md — Updated final-review usage label and environment variable table.

### Decisions Made
- Final review provider precedence is Gemini first, Claude Opus second.
- Step 6.5 is only skipped when both GEMINI_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY are absent.
- Output payload now includes provider metadata to make downstream processing explicit.

### Next Steps
- Run an end-to-end final-review dry run in both provider modes to validate response schema stability and timeout behavior.
